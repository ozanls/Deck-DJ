# Deck-DJ


The YGO Consistency Calculator aims to simplify the calculations to maximize the consistency
of players' decks allowing players to make meaningful adjustments and increase their
competitive success. Users will be able to build decks within the application.
Soundbyte is an application that allows users to upload and share music and audio. Users can
upload a sound clip and assign a genre to them.
Deck DJ is the combination of these two products, by associating different genres of music to
specific card types found in Yu-Gi-Oh, once users have created a deck, they will also have a
random playlist generated based on the cards found in their deck.
